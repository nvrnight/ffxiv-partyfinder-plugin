# PF Search Plugin

Commands:  
/pf  
/pf on  
/pf off  
  
You can enter custom search/exclusion expression criterias. The buttons help generate these for common search scenarios. When this plugin is "on" and you refresh your party finder listings, it will search the descriptions of these listings and also filter based on the raids you've selected. For each party that meets the search criteria there will be a chat message with a link to join the party and a notification sound will be played.
